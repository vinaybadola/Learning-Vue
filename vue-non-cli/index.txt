Q1. Difference Between Mounting And Rendering A Component In Vue.JS

Ans: Mounting: Mounting is the process of adding a Vue.js component to the DOM (Document Object Model) for the first time. When a component is mounted. 
    1. Creating a new instance of the component.
    2. Setting up the component’s data, computed properties, and methods.
    3. Compiling the template of the component.
    4. Rendering the component to the DOM.

    In other words, mounting a component is the initialization process that Vue.js performs when it creates a new instance of the component and adds it to the page.
    Once a component is mounted, it is ready to be interacted with and updated.

Rendering: Rendering is the process of updating a component’s view based on changes to its data or props.
    1.Re-evaluating the component’s computed properties and methods.
    2.Updating the component’s data and props.
    3.Re-rendering the component’s template.
    4.Updating the DOM to reflect any changes made to the component.

    In other words, rendering is the process that Vue.js performs to update a component’s view based on changes to its state.
    Rendering can occur multiple times during the lifecycle of a component, depending on how often its data or props change
